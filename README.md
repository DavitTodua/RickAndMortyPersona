# MVP Clean Architecture
The Clean Swift is an architectural pattern based on Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture. 
It's commonly used in robust long-running applications, 
as the SOLID principles of clean architecture provide code for great maintainability and scalability.

In this example we use:
Configurators,
ViewControllers,
Presenters,
Routers,
Gateways and
UseCases

# Technical Overview
- UI is written in code and Storyboards are not in use
- Gateways, UseCases, NetworkLayer are used for data fetching and manipulation
- UIComponents are built separately, and they are super Reusable
- Routers are used for navigation
- Solid Principles Are Followed
- Dependencys are injected
- Some helper classes are included
